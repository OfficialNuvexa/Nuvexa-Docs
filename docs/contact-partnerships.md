Nuvexa supports early-stage project teams that align with our mission. We offer:

## Collaboration Guidelines

- Proposals should be clear, purpose-driven, and show mutual benefit
- White-label integrations and research pilots are considered case-by-case
- We prioritize quality over quantity — meaningful partnerships over surface-level exposure

All partnership decisions are made transparently through the core governance council and published within our DAO forum (when public governance is live).

## Let’s Build the Future Together

Nuvexa is more than a chain — it’s a movement toward intelligent, decentralized infrastructure.

Whether you're a developer, researcher, institution, or creator, we welcome your interest in contributing to this vision.
